# The Rigarium Project

I want to make a gaming peripheral that could replace a keyboard, for accessibility for those with limited hand movement, or other accessibility concerns.

The name comes from the person who inspired this project, and provides most of the data for the initial design.

This repository will contain as much information as I can about the research, data, design, ideas, all the information that comes out of making this. I want this to be as open as possible to allow replication and improvement, and of course adaptability! 

This might be a bit of a mess at first-- I'm bad at User Interface design, I don't really know what data to collect yet, and Test Subject 1 (henceforth known as Rig) is going to have to be patient with me as I perfect my data collection methods and perfect prototypes.

For now, most developments will be in the "research" and "data" sections of the repository-- build logs will be sure to follow as I start to build out prototypes.

If you stumble upon this and have questions or advice, please feel free to reach out to me at the@nodebotani.st!
