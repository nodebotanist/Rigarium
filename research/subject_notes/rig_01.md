## Initial Notes: Rig

11-11-2017

Problem: a botched hand surgery has led to very limited finger movement in the subjoct's left hand. Details to come as I figure out what questions to ask.

Rig has stated that one thing they would need is 50% more keys per unit of space. I will look into custom-design mechanical switches, either commercially available or custom design.

Rig has tried a keyboard layout where a modifier key changed the functionality of the q-v block, but this didn't help much. They agreed that static switches without too much reliance on modifier keys would be a high-priority design aspect.
