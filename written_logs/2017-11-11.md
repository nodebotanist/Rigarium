I got Rig to agree to be a test subject on this. I've been rattling around the idea in my head for a few days now and I feel like it would stretch so many skills that it would be an impossible opportunity to pass up!

I have a social obligation today, so most of the work today will be documenting and researching from the car and when not engaged socially. Honestly, a good hour was spent convincing the test subject to participate.

I have a few ideas already stewing: one being switches surrounding a finger, allowing a user to hit 4 switches per finger without much lateral movement. I'll sketch this up tonight when I'm not in a vehicle.  

I also have thoughts on prototyping: my 3d printer and capacitive keys will be the main staple, as building things with these is comparitively cheap and adaptable. The final design will most likely contain mechanical switches, but 3D printing may still be the way to go.

I'd like to make the keys fully programmable, as Rig relies heavily on macros while gaming and anything that gets in the way of that play style would negate the purpose.
