I got Rig to agree to be a test subject on this. I've been rattling around the idea in my head for a few days now and I feel like it would stretch so many skills that it would be an impossible opportunity to pass up!

I have a social obligation today, so most of the work today will be documenting and researching from the car and when not engaged socially. Honestly, a good hour was spent convincing the test subject to participate.

I have a few ideas already stewing: one being switches surrounding a finger, allowing a user to hit 4 switches per finger without much lateral movement. I'll sketch this up tonight when I'm not in a vehicle.
